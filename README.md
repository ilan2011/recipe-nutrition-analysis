## Introduction

Can we predict a recipe's calorie content based on its other nutritional information and characteristics? This analysis explores recipe data from Food.com to understand the relationships between different nutritional components and predict calorie content.

The dataset contains information from two main sources:
- RAW_recipes.csv: Contains recipe details including nutritional information, preparation time, and steps
- RAW_interactions.csv: Contains user ratings and reviews

After merging and cleaning, our analysis covers a comprehensive set of recipes with detailed nutritional profiles, including:
- Calories
- Total fat (PDV - Percentage of Daily Value)
- Sugar (PDV)
- Sodium (PDV)
- Protein (PDV)
- Saturated fat (PDV)
- Carbohydrates (PDV)
